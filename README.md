# FFOverlays
Graphics, Videos, and OBS configurations for Fragforce's Streams

## TL;DR
You can Download the most recent overlay, that includes the basic layout and all the logos and videos [HERE](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1B0INRjwXxINnHouKJN6Rb7-1bQnwF5-p)

## About this github
This is where you can find all the basic images Fragforce participants can use in their OBS stream layout to help standarize stream branding.

## Content Summary
There are four complete gaming layout pages:
```
OverlayBarBottomOnly 	White bar along the bottom of the screen, standard logo in the bottom left corner,
						designed to have game overlay completely fill the screen and be partially hidden behind the bar

OverlayBarsSmall 		White bar along the bottom and left side of the screen, standard logo in the bottom left corner,
						designed to have game overlay fit to the space while not being hidden by the bar

OverlayBarsLarge		White bars along the bottom and left of the screen, Larger logo on the left side
						above the title.  The white bars take up (approximately) 20% of the space, allowing
						user to add text and webcam to the area without overlaying above game overlay space

SplitSetup				Specially Designed space designed for split camera or non-game focused uses, i.e. IRL 
						space with Twitch Chat, or two camera space.  Semi-transparent logo in bottom right corner
						recommended.
```

A fifth minimal layout can be used by simply using no bars, and adding the semi-transparent logo to a corner of the screen.

## Other File Includes
An offline logo png and a stream standby loop video are included in the content, which can each be used on their own as a offline image and as a standby animation.  You will also find a simple rectangle overlay in this repository, this can be used as a border around any widescreen item, including webcams or widgets, to give a neater feel to any inserted pieces.

## Theme Requirements
The transparent animated logos used in the layouts must be uncompressed AVI files (as they use png transparency) and as such are larger files.  Those are not on the github, but can be found in the google drive folder [HERE](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1B0INRjwXxINnHouKJN6Rb7-1bQnwF5-p).  Make sure you get both the standard logo and the Transparent one if you need them.  Alternatively, you can use the static png logo included in this repository to reduce processing overhead and size.

## TODO List
- The overlay file currently only includes the visual elements and doesnt include widget selection, layouts, or themes.
- The suggestion has been made to change the color scheme in the split screen layout, so this should be looked in to.
